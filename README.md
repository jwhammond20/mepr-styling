# Mepr-Styling

I took on the task of customizing the MemberPress styling across the entire Dynasty Nerds website to enhance the overall UX/UI. Using my skills in HTML, CSS, and UX/UI design, I was able to create a more visually appealing and user-friendly experience for our members. By customizing the styling of MemberPress, we were able to create a cohesive and consistent look and feel throughout the site. 

Not only did this improve the aesthetics of the site, but it also improved the functionality of MemberPress, making it easier for our users to navigate and access their membership benefits. Our members have reported a more enjoyable and seamless experience, leading to higher satisfaction rates and increased engagement on the site. 

Feel free to test out the customized MemberPress styling on our deployed site and see the difference for yourself!
